title: MOVEit exploitation CVE-2023-34362
description: MOVEitTransfer is affected by a critical vulnerability CVE-2023-34362. Exploited hosts show evidence of dynamically compliling a DLL, which then executes a script (file path for this temp file is C:\Windows\TEMP\[random]\[random].cmdline) to create a webshell that so far has always been named 'human2.aspx'.  The filepaths 'c:\moveittransfer\wwwroot' and  'C:\Windows\Microsoft\.NET\Framework64\v4\.0\.30319\Temporary ASP\.NET Files\root' should be investigated for recently modified files.  Evidence of exploitation can also be found on the webserver logs for the MOVEit Transfer application.
