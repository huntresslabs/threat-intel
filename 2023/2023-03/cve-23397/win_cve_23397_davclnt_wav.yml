title: Possible CVE-2023-23397
id: 00c2ad6a-fb88-42c9-bc48-57450e33ea0f
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects suspicious Rundll32 WebDAV client execution with observed .WAV artifact added to the UNC path.
    The .WAV is associated with the value stored in the PidLidReminderFileParameter which determines the audio tone to use in a missed meeting or overdue task.
    The UNC path in the attack forces the victim machine to look for the file on a remote server where the victim machine attempts to authenticate -- subsequently leaking NTLM hashes.
